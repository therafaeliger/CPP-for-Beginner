## Input-Output in C++

### Input
* std::     => get member function from iostream
* cout      => console out
* "<<"      => operator insertion
* "..."     => this is text (stream)
* endl      => end line ("\n")
* return 0  => return to main function (no error)

### Input
* cin       => console in
* ">>"      => operator insertion

## Variable
```cpp
int a = 1;
```

## Declaration
```cpp
int a; // this is declaration
a = 1; // hard code
```

## Tips
```cpp
using namespace std; // no need of write "std::"
// but it has disadvantages, it is okay for simplify the code
```
